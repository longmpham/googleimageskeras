# This python script allows the user to find images from Google, 
# parse the URL and then download the image from a simple query
# and save it to a drive. The user will be able to select the simple query
# like "Dog" in Google Search to produce the dataset. 
# I'm hoping that I will be able to select up to 100 or more images
